## Background
Rwanda has experienced substantial economic growth in the past decade.  However, chronic child malnutrition -- otherwise knowns as stunting -- remains high, with 37% of children under 5 being abnormally short for their age. The effects of stunting are long-term: stunted children have decreased cognitive development and poor physical development. Moreover, stunting has been associated with lower economic potential of countries. We’ve been working with USAID’s Rwanda office over the past year to help them identify where geographically stunting is highest, how stunting has changed over time, and what factors influence stunting.
In this project, you’ll process and analyze 2014/15 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey Data to assess household-level factors associated with stunting in children under 60 months.
